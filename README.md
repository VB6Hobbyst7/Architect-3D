# Architect-3D
## 3D Modeling software created in Visual Basic 2010
### The intended purpose of this project is to design 3D architectural models.
* __Features included:__
  * Camera functions:
  * Zoom
  * 360 Orbit
  * Traverse
* __Drawing functions:__
  * Line to
  * Square
  * Triangle
  * Curve
  * Rectangular Prism
  * Text Label(2D Text at 3D point)
  * Line Color and Fill Color
* __Data storage:__
  * BackBuffer  _     zone(i)(j).mesh(k)
  * FrontBuffer _       model(j).mesh(k)
  * Import and Export Model Data (modelname.dat)
  * Save and Load Zone Data (zonename.dat)
  * Save Image (image.jpg)
* __Motion:__
  * Frame refreshing
  * Continuous model orbit
  * Continuous model spin
  * Switch controlled Translate >X,Y,Z
  * Switch controlled Rotation  >X,Y,Z

* Every project is a work in progress Architect 3D is a working program with few minor Glitches:
  * Rotation of models is limited to position, does not always rotate in place
   Models rotate around a common center vector, orbits around world origin.
  * When welding models does not recalculate common origin.
